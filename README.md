# Trading Bot

## Overview

This project aims to develop a trading bot that will be used for paper trading. The bot will simulate trading activities without involving real money. It is being developed as a personal project during my free time.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this trading bot is to gain experience and knowledge in algorithmic trading. By building and testing different trading strategies, I hope to improve my understanding of financial markets and trading techniques.

## Approach

At this stage, the specific details of how the trading bot will work are still uncertain. I am exploring various approaches and considering different factors such as technical analysis indicators, market data, and risk management techniques. The development process will involve researching, implementing, and backtesting different strategies to evaluate their effectiveness.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this trading bot is purely for educational and experimental purposes. It will not involve real money trading. Any trading decisions made by the bot should not be considered as financial advice. The performance of the bot in simulated trading does not guarantee similar results in real trading scenarios.
